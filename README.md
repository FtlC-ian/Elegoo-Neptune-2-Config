# Elegoo-Neptune-2-Config

StockFirmware/Neptune 2（V1.0.3）最新固件.zip  contains the latest version of stock firmware as of June 18th 2021 (1.0.3) for the Elegoo Neptune 2.  Copy the files to the root of your SD card to update.
 
 BLTouch/elegoo_cfg_BLTOUCH.cfg is the config file I used to get BL Touch working w/ this firmware. If you're already on v 1.0.3 all you need to do is put this file on your sd card named as 'elegoo_cfg.txt'
 
 BLTouch/Instructions.pdf is an english translated version of how to connect and setup BL Touch.
 
 BLTouch/BL Touch Mount.STL is the elegoo official BL Touch mount for the Neptune 2 (there's an adjustable one on thingiverse that I use)

StockFirmware/V2.0.1.zip contains the new firmware v2.0.1 which is only compatible with the newer v1.3 boards. (you have to open the electronics panel to be sure)
